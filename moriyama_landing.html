            <p class="intro-text">Whitechapel Gallery proudly presents “Moriyama Daido”, a survey showing the beginnings and later development of the influential photographer Moriyama Daido.</p>
            <p>Widely recognized for his innovative, highly personal and unvarnished depictions of urban life, Moriyama was a founding member of Provoke, an avant-garde magazine published between 1969 and 1970, now regarded as a seminal work of post-war Japanese art. Formed by a small group of left-wing photographers, the magazine sought to redefine the medium while chronicling the nation’s social and political turmoil. Amid the upheaval of post-war regeneration, Moriyama documented Japan’s transformation through its outcasts and underdogs. Characters such as back-street boxers, strippers, and gay prostitutes figured in his signature black-and-white, grain-heavy style. Reflecting shifts in Japanese society through its simultaneous globalization and urban deprivation, the highly textured and dramatically contrasted images of the Shinjuku area of Tokyo depicted the fragmentary nature of Japan’s modern realities.</p>

            <p>His expressive “are, bure, boke” (rough, blurred and out-of-focus) aesthetic and his method of taking quick snapshots without looking through the viewfinder are two distinctive features of Moriyama’s work. The images are a result of experimenting with light, shade and abstraction while allowing for photographic chance. Largely shot with a small hand-held automatic camera, Moriyama’s work is often partially out of focus or shot on a diagonal composition, adding rawness and energy to his urgent photographic style.</p>

            <p>Anchoring the exhibition is a photograph taken of a stray dog in Japan’s Aomori Prefecture. The distinctively high contrast image is iconic of Moriyama and a symbol of the artist himself- he too is an urban rambler, prowling from alley to alley while capturing his stripped down vision of the streets. Photographs at the core of his oeuvre include the “Japan Photo Theatre” series from 1968. Loosely centred on avant-garde theatre, these seamy portraits of actors and nightclub performers remain some of Moriyama’s best known images. The fish-netted legs shot close-up in the “Tights” series is a sensual exploration of texture and hard abstraction, guiding the eye to dwell on formal elements that might otherwise go unnoticed. While in “Japan Photo Theatre” Moriyama depicts Tokyo’s entertainment district as a manifestation of the city’s desires, the fragmentary images of the legs and tights similarly capture an erotic instinct.</p>

            <p>Moriyama has been influenced by a diverse range of artists, from Japanese photographers Eikoh Hosoe and Shomei Tomatsu, to the writer Yukio Mishima, Andy Warhol, American photographers William Klein, Weegee, Eugene Atget and Jack Kerouac's On the Road. “Light and Shadow” is a series from the 1980s which shows Moriyama’s sensibility in shooting objects and abstract scenes. Like a photographic diary with shots taken in motion, there is a sense of narrative and the passage of time. Citing Kerouac’s On the Road as one of his greatest influences, his photographs are a record of his wanderings in which the journey is as important as the destination.</p>

            <p>Daido Moriyama (b. 1938) was born in Osaka, Japan and moved to Tokyo in 1961, where he continues to live and work. His work has been collected by prominent public and private collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The Getty Museum, Los Angeles, The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and The Centre Pompidou, Paris. Moriyama has had over 100 solo exhibitions worldwide, including major shows at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, The Fondation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain, Paris, The Fotomuseum, Winterthur, Switzerland, The Folkwang, Essen, Germany, The National Museum of Art Osaka and the Metropolitan Museum of Photography in Tokyo. He was recently given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the International Centre of Photography and his work has been the subject of joint retrospective with William Klein at Tate Modern (2012).</p>

    			  <p class="intro-text">Daido Moriyama is a master of street photography, but the way he sees himself is a little more humble.</p>
    			  <div class="medium-6 large-6 columns no-left-padding">
    			  <p class="last">“When I have a project I am working on, I’ll basically leave my place before noon like a stray dog,” he says in his biographical film “Memories of Dog.” The Japanese photographer, now 76, likens his working method to that of an animal on the prowl, “circling like a stray dog or alley cat, or even sometimes like an insect. I’ll go from alley to alley, resurface and then enter another alley, and I just wander.”</p>

    			  <p>Despite his age, he said he continues to wander the streets to capture the “true reality of life,” especially in his preferred neighborhood of Shinjuku, home to Tokyo’s largest red-light district.</p>

    			  <p>“I like the smell of desires, and Shinjuku is the gathering place of all desires,” he told the audience. </p>

    			  <p>Born in 1938, Mr. Moriyama grew up amid the upheavals of post-war Japan. Fascinated by society’s outcasts and underdogs, he has documented his country’s transformation through characters such as back-street boxers and gay prostitutes, all pictured in his signature black-and-white, grain-heavy style. One of his most iconic images is the 1971 “Stray Dog,” showing a street dog looking back at the photographer with menace.</p>

    			  <p>At first glance, Mr. Moriyama’s snapshots may appear almost amateurish, with their haphazard focus, off-kilter angles and depictions of mundane subjects such as cars in motion and legs covered in fishnet stockings. “Anything can be sexy,” he said. “On the streets of Taipei, I even find the engines of the motorbikes very sexy.”</p>

    			  <p>In his five-decade long career, he hasn’t shied away from provocation: a photograph in his first photo book, “Japan: A Photo Theater” (1968), depicted an aborted fetus at a Tokyo hospital.</p>

    			  </div>
    			  <div class="medium-6 large-6 columns no-left-padding">
    			  <p>“For me, a picture represents a moment of intimate conversation between the photographer and the person or object of what he is photographing,” he said. “A picture not only captures my personal emotions and thoughts, but also captures the memories of that place and scars that history has left there.”</p>

    			  <p>Mr. Moriyama has been compared to the American-born French street photographer William Klein, a decade his senior, with whom he recently shared a retrospective at London’s Tate Modern. Yet he believes his journey to be different from that of his Western colleague, who has also dabbled in fashion, filmmaking and painting. Mr. Moriyama, the son of an insurance salesman, sees himself strictly as a street photographer, with no plans to change.</p>

    			  <p>Though he now enjoys world-wide fame, his life as a photographer was not always smooth sailing. In 1972, his creativity and inspiration hit a dead end, leaving him with a sharp sense of despair — which served as the motivation for one of his most renowned series, “Farewell, Photography.”</p>

    			  <p>Standing in front of images from the series, Mr. Moriyama explained that at that time, his frustration reached the point where he wanted to quit photography.</p>

    			  <p>He wasn’t ready to go so fast, however.</p>

    			  <p>“Before leaving it, I wanted to destroy it,” the photographer said. “But when I tried to destroy it, that’s when I realized I couldn’t live without it.”</p>
